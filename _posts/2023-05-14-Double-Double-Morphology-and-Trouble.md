- Exploring verb reduplication in Indonesian
- Modifications in the implementation of Indonesian Grammar:
  - Incorporating morphonemic facts that pertain to sound changes in the morpheme
  - Establishing rules for constructing derived words that display reduplication



<details><summary>What the above means in simple terms.</summary>

<p>In simple terms, it means that the paper is about a particular aspect of the Indonesian language, which is when a verb is repeated and has a specific sound added to it. The paper explains recent changes made to the way the Indonesian language is taught, specifically how to account for the way sounds change in certain parts of words and how to create new words using this repeated verb technique. The paper talks about two main issues related to these changes: how to deal with sound changes in words and how to create new words using this technique.</p>


<p>Let me try to explain using an example:</p>

<p>Let's say we have an Indonesian verb "makan" which means "to eat". In Indonesian, there is a process called "reduplication" where a part of the word is repeated to convey a specific meaning.</p>

<p>For example, if we repeat the first syllable of "makan", we get "mamakan". This reduplicated form "mamakan" conveys the meaning of "to eat repeatedly or in a continuous manner".</p>

<p>Now, in this paper, the authors investigate this process of reduplication in Indonesian verbs, specifically when the verb has an agentive voice affix "meN" and a homorganic nasal. They want to understand how to accurately account for the sound changes that occur during reduplication and how to create word formation rules for derived words that exhibit reduplication.</p>

<p>In other words, they are trying to better understand how to accurately represent the process of reduplication in Indonesian verbs in their language model.</p>
